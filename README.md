## Dependencies
+ CUDA 11.0
+ Python 3.7
+ PyTorch 1.3.1 
+ pip packages in `requirements.txt`


## Dataset


## Config


## Evaluation

The required python packages need to be installed using the provided `requirements.txt`:  

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
To run evaulation with the default config file located in `config/eval.yml` enter:

    python eval.py  

## Results
The results which consists of predicted semantic segmentation images and Tensorboard logging 
are stored in the `output` folder. The Tensorboard logs can be examined after installing [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) with the command:

    tensorboard --logdir output
